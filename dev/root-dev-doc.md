# Developer resources

Here you will find resources documenting the inner workings of Celte Server Meshing, sorted by topics.

This is still a work in progress, but you can expect to find diagrams and explainations about the various procedures performed by Celte, both from an algorithmic and from a network point of view.

## Fundamental concepts

### RPCs
RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) are methods that can be invoked on another machine and are at the very heart of Celte. See [this documentation](RPC.md).
