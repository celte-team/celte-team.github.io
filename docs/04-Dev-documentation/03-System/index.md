# System

This section documents internal engine and system-level features: replication, spawn flow, inputs and RPCs as exposed by the native bindings.

Key pages

- [Inputs](./Inputs/Inputs.md)
- [RPCs and CRPC patterns](./RPCS.md)
- [Property replication](./procedure-property-replication.md)
- [Spawn flow](./procedure-spawn.md)

Developer notes, bindings, and diagrams are provided here to help engine contributors and advanced integrators.
